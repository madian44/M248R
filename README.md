# M248R
I have started studying M248 (Analysing data) with the Open University. I am doing it for fun, and to keep an ageing brain exercised so, when I am no longer an OU student, I won't be able to afford proprietary software licences so this is my attempt to learn R, Rmarkdown, and how to use GitHub.

It is all a bit mysterious at the moment. I'm old enough to have outgrown any embarrassment at either my slowness in grasping coding skills or by rudimentary errors. When I was younger I would never have exposed my abilities to public scutiny so this is quite liberating.

This line was added by a git! (Guess who's been doing a Git Bash tutorial)

## Unit 1
I have added an Rmarkdown notebook, in which I try ro teach myself how to reproduce barcharts and histograms that look vaguely similar to the Minitab output from Activities and Exercises in the **M248 Computer Activity: Book A**.

Feel free to clone/download my code but feel even more at liberty to suggest improvements or compltely different ways of doing things (including how I am using GitHub).
